## Aim

The aim of the project was to create a full stack web application based on a game of our choice. The brief for the project was:

    - Create a browser game based on an existing card or dice game. 
    - Model and test the game logic and then display it in the browser for a user to interact with.
    - Write your own MVP with some specific goals to be achieved based on the game you choose to model.
    - You might use persistence to keep track of the state of the game or track scores/wins. 
    - Other extended features will depend on the game you choose.
    
As a team, we settled on the following MVP:   

    - To create a Top Trumps game utilising Simpson characters
    - Player versus player
    - Must be able to render individual cards from database
    - Must be able to show all of the cards
    - Must be able track player decks

The following extensions were completed: 

    - Player versus computer
    - To be able to Create, Update and Delete your own card
